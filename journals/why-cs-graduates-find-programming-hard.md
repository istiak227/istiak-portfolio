summary: 'The strugle to write code of a computer science graduate.'
---

This is often a common scenario of Bangladesh that a CS/IT graduate from any of the reputed/not reputed universities finds programming difficult. They know what data structure is, how a computer works, how machine interprets programming language to machine language to bite code, but they are often scared to print ‘Hello World’ into the console.
See here I used scared instead of cannot or could not. They are just simply scared. My experience with some of my trainees and interns led me to use this verb. Every programmer struggles with writing the first line of code. Just by reading the docs and following the tutorials, no one gets it for the first time. But Every time you keep writing them things starts to unwind. Logics behind code becomes cleared each day you write ``‘Hello World’``.

I did not know the power of hello world while I was in my undergrad, So I was also scared to write code even though I graduated from a prestigious university with a not so bad CGPA.

Programming and writing codes become easier once you get your hands dirty. By writing garbage, redundant, spaghetti code. The more you write the cleaner it becomes. I like to explain things with metaphors. Let’s finish this one with that,
A teacher gave a task to two of his group. The task was simply to make a pot from clay and ceramic. But the instructions were different, one group was told to make only one ceramic, but it needs to be the best. The other one was instructed to make as many pots as possible and present the last made pot. Guess, which group’s pot was the winner.
The group that made hundreds of pots! In the beginning, it is not what you would expect. But it becomes better and easier every day. So my fellow comrades, keep hanging on printing 

``Hello World!``
